## Amazon_Vine_Analysis
### Overview
The purpose of the project is to analyzing one of the Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. A little background on what the Amazon Vine program is, it is a  service that allows publishers and manufacturers to receive reviews for their products. 

For this project I choose the music dataset: 	   
https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/tsv/amazon_reviews_us_Music_v1_00.tsv.gz
### Results
  •	There were 7 Vine reviews and 10597 non-vine reviews.
  
  •	There were zero 5-star reviews for vines and 67580 for non-vine reviews.
  
  •	The percentage of 5-star non-vine reviews was 63.77%. The percentage of 5-star vine reviews was 0%
### Summary
As you can see from the result, there is a great deal of bias. With non-vine member giving favorable reviews or giving view in general. With there being a significant difference in the amount of reviews give between non-vine and vine members I would suggest look at review with a star rating of 1 or 2 to get an accurate reading.
